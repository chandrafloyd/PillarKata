# PillarKata

This was built in the Sublime Text Editor using HTML and JavaScript. I did the builds alternately using Chrome and Internet Explorer. There are no dependencies on external files.

Background

This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward:

The babysitter:

starts no earlier than 5:00PM
leaves no later than 4:00AM
gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
Feature: As a babysitter In order to get paid for 1 night of work I want to calculate my nightly charge
